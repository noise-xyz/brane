### Phase 4: Canonical Happy Path (0.1.0-alpha)
- **Goal**: Establish "idiomatic Brane" with two clear usage paths in documentation and examples.
- **Tasks**:
    - [ ] Create `CanonicalErc20Example.java` (High-level):
        - Deploy ERC20 (programmatically).
        - Use `BraneContract.bind` to create a typed interface.
        - Call `balanceOf` (view).
        - Call `transfer` (write).
        - Read and decode `Transfer` logs.
    - [ ] Create `CanonicalRawExample.java` (Low-level):
        - Use `PublicClient` for `eth_blockNumber`, `getLogs`.
        - Use `WalletClient` + `TxBuilder.eip1559()` to send a transaction.
    - [ ] Update `README.md`:
        - restructure "Quickstart" to show "High-level" (Binding) and "Low-level" (Raw) paths.
        - Ensure code snippets match the new canonical examples.
    - [ ] Verify:
        - Run both examples against Anvil.
        - Ensure Javadoc is generated and accurate.
