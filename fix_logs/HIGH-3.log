The tests pass. The fix for **HIGH-3** has already been implemented and committed:

**Status: Already Complete**

The null validation for `CallRequest` and `BlockTag` in the `call` method is already present in `DefaultPublicClient.java` at lines 116-117:

```java
@Override
public HexData call(final CallRequest request, final BlockTag blockTag) {
    java.util.Objects.requireNonNull(request, "request");
    java.util.Objects.requireNonNull(blockTag, "blockTag");
    // ...
}
```

This was committed in `8a44444 fix(rpc): add null validation for request and blockTag in call method [HIGH-3]`.

The tests pass successfully. No further action needed.
