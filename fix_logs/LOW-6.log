Done. I've completed the fix for LOW-6:

**Summary:**
- Added comprehensive Javadoc to the `ValueParts` record in `DefaultWalletClient.java:522-545`
- The documentation explains:
  - The record's purpose: extracting and normalizing transaction values for building and logging
  - Each parameter's meaning with `@param` tags
  - How the record handles both legacy and EIP-1559 transaction types (some fields are null depending on type)
- Tests pass and code compiles cleanly
- Committed with message: `docs(rpc): add Javadoc to DefaultWalletClient.ValueParts record [LOW-6]`
