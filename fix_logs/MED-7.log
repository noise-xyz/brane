The fix for MED-7 is complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Summary: MED-7 Fix

**Issue:** Fix MulticallBatch ThreadLocal leak risk. Add IllegalStateException detection when recordCall finds stale pending call. Document cleanup requirement prominently in Javadoc.

**Changes made to `MulticallBatch.java`:**

1. **Class-level Javadoc (lines 17-65):**
   - Added prominent `<h2>IMPORTANT: ThreadLocal Cleanup Requirement</h2>` section
   - Documented the ThreadLocal mechanism and cleanup requirements
   - Added "Leak Detection" section explaining the fail-safe IllegalStateException
   - Added "Safe Patterns" section with three usage patterns (direct chaining, try-finally, debugging with hasPending)
   - Added warning about thread pools and virtual threads
   - Added `@see` references to `clearPending()` and `hasPending()`

2. **`recordCall()` method Javadoc (lines 221-239):**
   - Improved documentation with "ThreadLocal Safety" section
   - Added "Stale Call Detection" section explaining the fail-safe behavior
   - Added `@throws IllegalStateException` documentation

3. **`clearPending()` method Javadoc (lines 280-303):**
   - Added prominent "IMPORTANT" callout
   - Added code example showing proper usage in catch handlers
   - Improved return value documentation

**Note:** The stale call detection code at lines 232-237 was already correctly implemented (clears before throwing) - the fix focused on making the cleanup requirement more prominent in the documentation.
