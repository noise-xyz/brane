Done. I've completed the fix for T3-1:

**Summary:**
- Removed the deprecated `getCode()` and `getData()` methods from `RpcException` (lines 74-100)
- These methods were marked `@Deprecated(since = "0.2.0", forRemoval = true)` but served no backward compatibility purpose
- Verified no usages of these methods exist in the codebase via grep search
- All tests pass and the code compiles successfully
