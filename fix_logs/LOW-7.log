Successfully completed **LOW-7**. Here's a summary of the changes made:

## Summary

Standardized `var` usage across the brane-rpc module following the project convention: **use `var` only when RHS makes type obvious** (e.g., constructor calls), but keep explicit types for method return values and domain types.

### Files Modified

1. **DefaultPublicClient.java** - 7 changes
   - Changed `var response` to `JsonRpcResponse response` for `sendWithRetry()` calls (6 occurrences)
   - Changed `var req` to `Map<String, Object> req` for `buildLogParams()` result

2. **SmartGasStrategy.java** - 3 changes
   - Changed `var from` and `var to` to `Object from` and `Object to` for `Map.get()` calls
   - Changed `var latest` to `BlockHeader latest` for `getLatestBlock()` result
   - Added missing `BlockHeader` import

3. **DefaultWalletClient.java** - 2 changes
   - Changed `var decoded` to `RevertDecoder.Decoded decoded` for `RevertDecoder.decode()` calls (2 occurrences)

### Kept as `var` (correctly)
- Constructor calls where type is obvious: `new ArrayList<>()`, `new LinkedHashMap<>()`, `new StringBuilder()`
