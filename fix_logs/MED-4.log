Successfully fixed **MED-4**. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Summary

**Issue:** `BraneAsyncClient` default executor lifecycle leak - the default executor wasn't being cleaned up on JVM exit.

**Fix applied to** `brane-rpc/src/main/java/io/brane/rpc/BraneAsyncClient.java`:

1. **Added shutdown hook** (lines 60-69): Registered a JVM shutdown hook in a static initializer block that calls `shutdownNow()` on the default executor when the JVM exits.

2. **Enhanced class Javadoc** (lines 40-45): Added an "Executor Lifecycle" section documenting:
   - The default executor is automatically cleaned up via shutdown hook
   - Explicit shutdown is still needed for container reloads (Spring Boot) and test frameworks
   - The executor will be lazily recreated if needed after manual shutdown

3. **Updated field Javadoc** (lines 54-56): Referenced the shutdown hook in the `DEFAULT_EXECUTOR_REF` field documentation.

The fix ensures that:
- Normal usage doesn't require explicit cleanup (shutdown hook handles it)
- Container environments and test frameworks can still call `shutdownDefaultExecutor()` for explicit cleanup between reloads
- The lazy recreation behavior is preserved for flexibility
