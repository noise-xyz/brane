The fix is complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Summary - MED-4 Fix

**Issue:** Race condition in `BraneAsyncClient` default executor shutdown where `get()` followed by `shutdown()` could fail if another thread created a new executor between those operations.

**Fix:** Changed both `shutdownDefaultExecutor(long)` and `shutdownDefaultExecutorNow()` to use `getAndSet(null)` instead of `get()`, atomically retrieving and nullifying the executor reference before initiating shutdown.

**Changes:**
1. `shutdownDefaultExecutor(long timeoutMillis)`: Now uses `DEFAULT_EXECUTOR_REF.getAndSet(null)` to atomically get-and-nullify
2. `shutdownDefaultExecutorNow()`: Same atomic pattern, and now returns `List<Runnable>` of pending tasks
3. Added comprehensive thread safety documentation in class Javadoc and both method Javadocs

**Commit:** `f41e730 fix(rpc): fix BraneAsyncClient default executor shutdown race condition [MED-4]`
