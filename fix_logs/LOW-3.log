Issue **LOW-3** is already fixed (commit 48549ca). Summary:

1. Applied `@InternalApi` annotation to `RpcUtils` class
2. Updated the Javadoc to clarify that methods are public only due to cross-package access requirements

The fix follows the task's second option ("add @InternalApi annotation") because making methods package-private would break the build - `RpcUtils` is in `io.brane.rpc.internal` but is used by classes in `io.brane.rpc`, and Java's package-private access doesn't extend to parent packages.
