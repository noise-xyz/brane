Done. The fix for **LOW-1** is complete:

**Summary:**
- Replaced old-style `instanceof` checks with Java 21 pattern matching in `WebSocketClientHandler.channelRead0` method
- Changed `if (msg instanceof FullHttpResponse) { FullHttpResponse response = (FullHttpResponse) msg; ...` to `if (msg instanceof FullHttpResponse response) { ...`
- Changed `if (msg instanceof WebSocketFrame) { WebSocketFrame frame = (WebSocketFrame) msg; ...` to `if (msg instanceof WebSocketFrame frame) { ...`
- Changed `if (frame instanceof TextWebSocketFrame) { TextWebSocketFrame textFrame = (TextWebSocketFrame) frame; ...` to `if (frame instanceof TextWebSocketFrame textFrame) { ...`
- Unit tests pass
- Committed as `a4ad04e`
