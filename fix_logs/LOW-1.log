Done. I've completed the LOW-1 fix:

**Summary:**
- Replaced old-style cast `(FullHttpResponse) msg` at line 543 with Java 21 pattern matching `if (msg instanceof FullHttpResponse response)`
- The pattern matching approach is safer as it includes the type check before using the variable
- Unit tests pass
- Committed with: `refactor(rpc): use Java 21 pattern matching in WebSocketClientHandler.channelRead0 [LOW-1]`
