The fix for MED-6 is complete. Here's a summary of the changes:

**Summary:**
- Added `BraneMetrics` support to `HttpBraneProvider` to match the `WebSocketProvider` pattern
- Added `setMetrics(BraneMetrics metrics)` method with Javadoc
- Added `metrics.onRequestFailed(method, ex)` call when HTTP errors occur (status codes outside 200-299)
- The existing `log.warn` logging was already present and has been preserved

The HTTP error logging now has three layers of observability:
1. `DebugLogger.logRpc()` - Internal debug logging
2. `log.warn()` - SLF4J warning level logging
3. `metrics.onRequestFailed()` - Metrics hook for monitoring systems (Micrometer, Prometheus, etc.)
