Fixed **MED-1**. The changes:

1. **Enhanced Javadoc in `Client.java`** (lines 48-56): Added a "Null result handling" section explaining:
   - When null is returned (when JSON-RPC response contains a null result)
   - Why null is valid (absence of data for certain RPC methods)
   - Examples of methods that can return null (`eth_getTransactionByHash`, `eth_getBlockByNumber/Hash`, `eth_call`)
   - Guidance that callers should handle null based on method semantics

2. **Added `@Nullable` annotation**: Added `org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable` to both:
   - `Client.call()` interface method
   - `RpcClient.call()` implementation

This makes the null-return behavior explicit in both documentation and the type system, allowing static analysis tools to help catch potential NPEs.
