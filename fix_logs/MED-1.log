Done! I've fixed **MED-1** by:

1. **Added Javadoc to `RpcClient.call()`** (`RpcClient.java:90-98`) - Documents that the method intentionally returns `null` when the JSON-RPC response contains a null result, following the Ethereum JSON-RPC specification where null indicates absence of data (e.g., non-existent transaction or block).

2. **Added a test** (`RpcClientTest.java:32-48`) - `returnsNullWhenResultIsNull()` test verifies that when the JSON-RPC response has a null result, the `call()` method returns `null` rather than throwing an exception.

The fix documents the existing consistent behavior (always return null for null results) rather than changing it to throw, since:
- The `Client` interface already documents this behavior
- Returning null is the correct semantic for Ethereum RPC methods where null indicates "not found"
- Throwing would be a breaking change for callers expecting null
