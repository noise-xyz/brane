The fix for **MED-8** has been completed. Here's a summary:

## Summary

Fixed the WebSocketProvider reconnect losing pending requests issue by adding an explicit state machine for connection state management.

### Changes Made to `WebSocketProvider.java`:

1. **Added `ConnectionState` enum** with four states:
   - `CONNECTING` - Initial connection in progress
   - `CONNECTED` - WebSocket is connected and ready for requests  
   - `RECONNECTING` - Connection lost, reconnect in progress (requests rejected)
   - `CLOSED` - Provider is permanently closed

2. **Added `AtomicReference<ConnectionState>`** for thread-safe state transitions

3. **Updated `sendAsync()` and `sendAsyncBatch()`** to check state at method entry:
   - Returns failed future with `RpcException(-32000, "WebSocketProvider is closed")` if CLOSED
   - Returns failed future with `RpcException(-32000, "WebSocket is reconnecting - request rejected to prevent loss")` if RECONNECTING

4. **Updated state transitions**:
   - `connect()`: Sets state to `CONNECTED` on successful connection
   - `channelInactive()`: Sets state to `RECONNECTING` before calling reconnect
   - `reconnect()`: Sets state to `CLOSED` when max retries exceeded
   - `close()`: Sets state to `CLOSED` before failing pending requests

5. **Added `getConnectionState()`** public accessor for monitoring and diagnostics

This fix ensures that requests sent during a reconnection attempt are explicitly rejected with a clear error message instead of being silently lost when the channel is unavailable.
