Done. The HIGH-4 fix has been completed:

**Summary:**
- Added `import java.util.Objects;` to `DefaultPublicClient.java`
- Replaced all fully-qualified `java.util.Objects.requireNonNull` calls with `Objects.requireNonNull`
- Replaced `java.util.Objects::nonNull` with `Objects::nonNull`
- The null validation for the provider parameter was already present at line 72, but now follows the same pattern as `DefaultWalletClient`
- All tests pass
