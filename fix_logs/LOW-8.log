The fix has been completed and committed. Here's a summary of the changes made:

## Summary for LOW-8

**Fixed:** Inconsistent null handling in `LogParser.java`

**Changes made:**
1. Added `import org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable` 
2. Added `@Nullable` annotations to local variables that may hold null values from RPC response fields
3. Added comprehensive Javadoc to `parseLog()` documenting null handling for each field:
   - `address` - Required; throws if missing or null
   - `data` - Optional; null maps to `HexData.EMPTY`
   - `blockHash` - Nullable; null for pending logs
   - `transactionHash` - Required; throws if missing or null
   - `topics` - Optional; null maps to empty list
   - `logIndex` - Defaults to 0 if missing
   - `removed` - Defaults to false if missing
4. Documented the semantic difference between `HexData.EMPTY` ("0x" - explicitly empty data) and null (field omitted from RPC response)
5. Fixed inconsistent null handling: Previously the code passed `null` for `address` and `transactionHash` when they were missing, but `LogEntry`'s compact constructor requires these fields. Now they're passed directly to constructors, allowing the `NullPointerException` to propagate with a clear message.
6. Updated `parseLogStrict()` with similar documentation
